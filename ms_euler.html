		<p>		
The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, 
<strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, 
he studied under another giant of mathematics, <strong>Jean 
Bernoulli.</strong> In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics 
and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. 
Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time, 
publishing over <em>800 different books and papers.</em> His 
influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.
		</p>
		<p>
He is perhaps best known for his research into 
mathematical analysis. Euler's work, 
<cite>Introductio in analysin infinitorum</cite> (1748), 
remained a standard textbook in the field for 
well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau, 
he wrote 
<cite>Lettres &agrave; une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772)</cite>, 
giving a clear non-technical outline of the main 
physical theories of the time.
		</p>
		<p>
One can hardly write a mathematical equation without 
copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such 
as <var>e</var> and <var>&pi;</var>, were introduced 
in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783, 
leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and 
certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.

	<h1>The Most Beautiful Equation in Math?</h1>
	</header>
	
Perhaps the most elegant equation in the history of math is:<code>
<var>cos(x)+isin(x)=e^xi </var>
</code>
which demonstrates the relationship between algebra, 
complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this 
equation, it's easy to derive the identity:
<code>
<var>e^&pi;i+1=0 </var>
</code>
which relates the fundamental constants: 
0, 1, &pi;, e, and i in a single beautiful and 
elegant statement. A poll of readers 
conducted by The <cite>Mathematical Intelligencer
magazine</cite> named Euler's Identity as the 
most beautiful theorem in the history of 
mathematics.
