		<h1>About me!</h1>
			<article>
			<section>
				My name is Tori, I live in Springfield and I am here in college for my Associate of Applied Science degree.

			<section>
				I love to travel and HTML coding has always been a fun hobby of mine! I currently work at Walmart as a cashier, but I am on my way to being promoted to OGP, which is online shopping.

		<h2>My interests!</h2>
			<article>
				I love Quake and Metroid! I play a ton of games when I'm not busy with work or school. 
				I also work with the lostmediawiki to preserve old TV Shows, movies, games etc. Archiving stuff is surprisingly fun and satisfying!
			<section>
				I also draw on my downtime, as well as write.
